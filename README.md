Original code by Brian Advent
YouTube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz6-IQV_qDw

FOLLOWING ALONG WITH MR. ADVENT'S CODE FROM HIS VIDEO TUTORIAL FROM 4TH DECEMBER, 2016,
I DECIDED TO MAKE HIS CODE A LITTLE MORE SWIFT LIKE, AND A LOT SAFER.

I ALSO NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK WITH A SPRITE KIT LABEL NODE.
THIS CODE ALSO ALLOWS FOR UNITS TO BE USED AFTER THE NUMBER e.g. "22kg" / "48.5Ib" (nb. THIS CODE WILL NOT CONVERT BETWEEN UNITS HOWEVER)

THIS CODE MAY BE USED IN A COMMERCIAL APPLICATION IF DESIRED.
